NF04 interpreter
====
This is a personal project of a javascript interpreter for the *NF04 Programming language*. The *NF04 language* is made for an algorithme introduction course (codename NF04) at my french university (UTT). Since the *NF04 language* is in french, a lot of text in the project is in french. However, all comments are in english (maybe bad english, sorry for that). And you can fork this project to make your own interpreter as this project is under [MIT license](https://github.com/AurelienLabate/nf04/blob/master/LICENSE) that let you do anything you want with my code as long as you provide attribution back to me (Aur√©lien Labate) and don't hold me liable.
